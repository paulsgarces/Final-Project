# Final-Project
For the final project for the class, I decided to switch my initial idea of looking at returns in the market
and instead focus on squirrels. The main question I aim to study is, "How do Squirrel's surroundings and
characteristics influence/affect their activity level?". From the https://data.gov/ link, I will be using a
CSV file called 2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census, which includes many columns/variables such as the X and Y
coordinates of the squirrel, their fur color, age, and what activities they were doing at the moment of being
studied. The list of activities includes eating, foraging, running, chasing, and climbing. 

For my first visualization, I decided to explore the relationship between age and activities and created a
stacked bar plot. In the dataset, squirrels have an age of either adult or juvenile. Adult means that they are
a year old and older, while a juvenile means that a squirrel is up to six months old. I then collected 
information on the activity that was being done. By looking at the stacked bar plot, it can be noted that adult
squirrels had higher activity levels across the board when compared to juvenile squirrels, who had very 
little activity. This can be attributed to the fact that juvenile squirrels are too young to be doing activities
such as foraging and climbing.
